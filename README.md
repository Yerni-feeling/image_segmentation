## Article 2
This [article] that was published by  Mary  Meehan is very well-writeen about Data Privacy. There are millions and millions databases around the world and all of them save particular private data of the people; and it is essential for them to ensure that the company/rganization they trust in have best security to protect their data.    
Author of this article also mentiones that all big companies focus their attention to gathering of the data to then create a better development strategy and some of them can be unethical in some cases, for example voice-activated devices that are listening all the time. Every interaction of the user with a software is used to create some kind of data to improve the performance of it and it potentially cause data leak. It makes me think about the importance of the methods to protect all those information, all those private data that are stored in apps that are created by thousand amounts every minute
